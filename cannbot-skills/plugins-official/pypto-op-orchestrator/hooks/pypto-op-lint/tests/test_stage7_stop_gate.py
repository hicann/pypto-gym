"""OL63 — Stage 7 completion gate on the PANKO path.

Two halves, and they pull in opposite directions.

The gate exists because the orchestrator must not end the search on its own
judgement that the result is good enough; on the PANKO path Stage 7 may only
complete once panko_harness.py's stop() has written a non-empty
progress.stop_reason.

But the stepwise path -- the default, and what every operator not asking for
PANKO is on -- never writes search_state.json at all. Keying the gate on the
file's presence therefore blocks the default path, so it is keyed on
stage7_tuning_mode in .orchestrator_state.json, which start_stage(7) records.
