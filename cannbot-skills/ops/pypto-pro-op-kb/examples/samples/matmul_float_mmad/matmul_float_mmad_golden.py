# Golden for the matmul_float_mmad transfer (pure torch, NO pypto — lint D3).
#
# SAMPLE PROVENANCE -- describes THIS reference implementation only.
# Do not copy this header into generated code: a generated kernel inherits
# no validation from the sample it was modelled on.
# The oracle and simulator artifacts matched exactly; the reference performance target is 1,483 cycles.
#   RE-STAMP BASIS (this PR): the edit that moved this hash was **text only** -- a
#   docstring/comment change with no executable difference, proved by comparing the
#   parsed AST with docstrings stripped before and after. The recorded result above was
#   NOT re-measured on a board. So this stamp asserts "semantically the same code as the
#   one that produced that record", which is weaker than `--stamp-validation-hashes`'s
#   normal meaning ("this exact code was just re-validated"). Re-run on target before
#   relying on it as a fresh result.
