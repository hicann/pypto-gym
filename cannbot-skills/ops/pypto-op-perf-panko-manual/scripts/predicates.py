"""predicates.py --- what structure does this kernel actually contain?

Answers a handful of yes/no questions about a candidate implementation so the
harness can hold back catalogue actions whose precondition the kernel does not
satisfy. Held, never deleted: the predicates are recomputed after every
accepted candidate, so a transformation that introduces a matmul re-admits the
cube actions that were unreachable a moment earlier.

That distinction is the whole design. A kernel without a matmul today may be
much faster with one tomorrow: on Ascend the Cube pipe has far higher
throughput than Vector, so rewriting a reduction as a matmul against a ones
vector is a real and large optimisation. Deleting the cube actions up front
would remove exactly that possibility.

Detection uses the AST, not text search, so a mention in a comment or a
docstring never counts as evidence.

CONSERVATIVE BY CONSTRUCTION: when a predicate cannot be determined it is
reported True, which admits the action. Wrongly holding an action back removes
a reachable optimisation; wrongly admitting one costs at most a few
evaluations, and the static feasibility gate catches most of those anyway.

Usage:
    preds = compute("custom/<op>/<op>_impl.py", op_dir="custom/<op>")

    carries state from trip i into trip i+1, and that state is the thing whose
    serial depth the chunk size trades against.

    The rule: a name that is stored somewhere in the loop body and LOADED before
    any store of it in the same iteration. A value produced and consumed within
    one trip (`t1 = silu(x); out[i] = mul(t1, y)`) is stored first, so it does
