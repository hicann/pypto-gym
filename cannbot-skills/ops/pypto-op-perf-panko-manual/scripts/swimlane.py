"""Features from a swim-lane trace, for the deterministic symptom index.

Why this exists
---------------
Until now the device half of that index read two scalars, `util` and `bubble`.
They answer one question -- *are the cores idle, and is the scheduler why* --
and they answer it well: the profiler's own `bubble_analysis.log` and the
median lane in `merged_swimlane.json` agree to the decimal on the same kernel,
so neither number is suspect.

What they cannot say is what the busy time was SPENT ON. A kernel can sit at
high utilisation with a low bubble rate -- healthy by both -- and still be
several times slower than the hand-written Ascend C kernel. A kernel that moves
twice the bytes it needs to is busy while it does it. Occupancy metrics score
that as success.

So the features here are deliberately about the SHAPE of the work rather than
its presence: how finely it is chopped, whether the two pipes are balanced,
whether anything was merged, and which tensors cross from Cube to Vector (the
hand-off that a fused kernel keeps on-chip and this one does not).

Nothing here enters `p` or `J`. These are diagnostics, on the same footing as
util and bubble, and every one of them may be absent: a trace that cannot be
read yields None and the symptoms simply do not fire.

Trace format
------------
`merged_swimlane.json` is Chrome-trace JSON. `ph:"M" name:"thread_name"` events
name the lanes (`AIC_n` = Cube, `AIV_n` = Vector, plus a `Fake Core_0` the
profiler uses for its own bookkeeping, which is not a core and is excluded).
`ph:"X"` events are tasks, with `ts`, `dur` and an `args` dict carrying
`hashOrder-hint` (subgraph merge info) and `ioperand-hint` / `ooperand-hint`
(tensor identities, as `rawmagic` integers).

`rawmagic` is coarse -- one recorded trace has 2 880 tasks over 37 distinct
magics -- so it identifies a BUFFER, not an individual value. Counting
producer/consumer task pairs therefore inflates wildly (1.18 M "edges" on that
trace). Cross-pipe traffic is counted per DISTINCT TENSOR instead, which is
small, interpretable, and matches what an action would act on.
