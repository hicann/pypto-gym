"""measure_latency.py — the frozen warm-latency measurement for PANKO E(x).

Used IDENTICALLY for the preopt baseline (INIT) and every candidate during the search, so the
`p` values are directly comparable. It fixes two bugs seen in ad-hoc measurement:

  1. Cold vs warm. The kernel's first call is cold (JIT compile / cache fill) and reads ~20-25%
     slower than the warm steady state. We run `warmup` calls and DISCARD them, then measure
     `runs` warm calls.
  2. Capture. The on-device profiler prints its "AICORE Prof Summary" at the native (fd) level,
     so Python's `redirect_stdout` (sys.stdout only) misses it. We redirect at the file-descriptor
     level (os.dup2) around the calls — keeping ONE warm process — then parse the captured text.

`p` = aggregate (median by default; min optional) of the warm "AICore End-to-End Time" values.
Only the on-device AICore time is used — never wall-clock (which includes host/profiling overhead).

The measurement MECHANICS below are the frozen part. The op-specific `run_once()` (build inputs +
one wrapper call + synchronize) is supplied by the caller / CLI.

    cube cores against 40 vector cores the vector pipe carries two thirds of the
    weight. A kernel whose vector pipe is saturated while its cube pipe is
    nearly idle therefore reads comfortably above the 50% floor that would have

    WAIT PREDECESSOR. `bubble_rate` counts only `wait_schedule`. On a
    pipe-serialized core nearly all of the stall is `wait_predecessor` instead
    -- the whole cost of a serial cube->vector->cube recurrence -- so it is

    site-packages, outside version control, alongside four earlier backups of the
    same file; adding a fifth would reproduce exactly the fragility that silently

    `tilefwk_L1_prof_data.json` is the INPUT that fast path still parses, so it

    one entry per core, `coreType` in {AIC, AIV}, and `tasks` carrying
    `execStart` / `execEnd`.

    What this recovers is utilisation only, and by print_aicore_summary's own
    definition -- busy task time over (core count x wall span) -- rather than the
    log's per-core busy/(busy+wait). The two nearly agree because a core's

    from analysis_wait_cycles, which is the thing the fast path skips. So
    `cube_starved`, which needs only utilisation, becomes available on every
