"""Admissibility of a kernel normalisation, decided statically.

Normalisation is the INIT step that turns a tile call written with named
constants into one written with integer literals:

    TILE_B, TILE_D = 16, 64
    pypto.set_vec_tile_shapes(TILE_B, TILE_D)   ->   pypto.set_vec_tile_shapes(16, 64)

`apply` tunes a tile call only when every argument is an integer literal --
correctly, because a name like `TILE_B` also drives the view's extent, the loop
bound and the host wrapper's padding, so rewriting the call alone would desync
them. The consequence is that whether the deterministic core owns the tile at all
depends on how the generated kernel happened to spell one call. In one campaign
a kernel that used literals had its tiles searched, while a kernel that used
names produced zero trials.

The rewrite itself is a semantic judgement -- which uses of `TILE_B` are the
view's extent and which are the tile's -- so a model writes it. This module is
the deterministic half: it decides whether what the model wrote is admissible.

The line, and it is the one claim the paper has to defend:

    normalisation exposes parameters and does not change values.

That is checkable here, before any device time is spent. Resolve the symbolic
call's arguments against the module's constant bindings and compare them to the
literals the model wrote. Equal, and no value moved. Different, and the model
optimised while it was refactoring -- which is a different thing, has to earn its
place through the search, and must not be smuggled into the baseline the whole
run is measured against.

What this module deliberately does NOT decide: whether the rewrite preserves
semantics. Constant folding is not enough to know that, and the golden test
already answers it exactly. Two gates, each doing the thing it can actually do.
