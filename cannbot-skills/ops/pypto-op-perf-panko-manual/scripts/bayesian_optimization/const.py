"""Which integer constants the deterministic core may tune, and where they sit.

`apply` tunes tile-call arguments. A constant that sets a loop trip count is
invisible to it, so the model has to sweep that number by hand, one structural
delta and one full evaluation per point, for what is a single BO dimension.

Selection is two-staged and the order matters. See
`references/tunable_constants.md` for the reasoning and the calibration.

  1. Read DIRECTLY inside a @jit annotation or a torch.* call -> part of the
     operator's declared interface. Excluded.
  2. Of the rest, admit only what reaches a `pypto.loop` trip count, directly or
     through a derivation. Reaching a loop bound means the constant sets an
     iteration count, which is what a tiling parameter does and what a declared
     extent does not.
  3. Everything else is left alone. The rule is default-deny.

Derivation is followed in stage 2 and NOT in stage 1: a constant typically
reaches its loop bound one derivation removed, while a constant whose derived
name reaches an annotation is not itself part of the interface.

Taint is propagated by name and ignores scope, so a name reused in two functions
over-taints. For stage 2 that is the conservative direction only in the sense of
admitting more; the incumbent-value check and the golden are what bound the cost.
