"""Startup points chosen to COVER the operating space, not to guess a good one.

Why not random
--------------
TPE's startup draws are uniform in PARAMETER space, and most of that volume is
either rejected or absurd. Two draws from one recorded block:

    {mL0:192, kL0:32, nL0:32, ...}  ->  22,198 us   (8.5x the incumbent)
    {mL0:512, kL0:64, nL0:32, ...}  ->  14,114 us

Both reached the device, and in FEATURE space they are nearly the same point --
a starved N dimension, an empty L0C, far too many trips. Two of a block's four
to eight measurements went to one operating regime.

Why not a model either
----------------------
The obvious repair is to seed where some computable quantity predicts a win.
Every such quantity tried on this benchmark has been refuted by measurement:
filling L0 (three configurations, all tie-or-worse), operand reuse per loaded
element (improved monotonically while latency got monotonically worse), padded
work against the core count, power-of-two alignment. One survived -- filling
L1 -- on a single operator. Seeding by a predictor built on that record would
repeat the mistake it is made of.

So this module predicts nothing. It measures FEATURES that are arithmetic
rather than theory -- how full each buffer is, how many loop trips there are,
how those trips divide across the cores -- and picks points that are as far
apart in that space as possible. Whatever the true relationship turns out to
be, the measurements span it, and the device answers the question instead of us.

Two facts here are arithmetic and are used as such, not as models:
`trips < cube_cores` leaves cores with no work at all, and a tile occupying a
small fraction of a buffer runs the loop proportionally more times.

Cost
----
Candidates are filtered by the existing static gate BEFORE selection, so a
startup point can no longer be spent on a configuration the harness would have
rejected anyway. Nothing here touches the device.
