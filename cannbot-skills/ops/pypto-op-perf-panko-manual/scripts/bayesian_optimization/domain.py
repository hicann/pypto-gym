"""What the core can say about a tile, and what it must be told.

A tile is bounded by the hardware, not by the program's views: in PyPTO a tile
shape and a view shape are independent quantities. So there are two rules, and
only two.

    trailing dimension is 16-aligned        (in `space`; a compiler rule,
                                             recorded in ERR_CONFIG_ALIGNMENT)
    footprint x dtype x live tiles <= UB    (here)

Neither was enforced. `_vec_feasible` checked the alignment and stopped; the
harness constructed `HW(calibrated=False)`, which switched off even the checks
that existed. A ceiling seed larger than the buffer can hold at the kernel's
live-tile count then reaches the device, returns s=0, and records a PENALTY at
the region of interest -- teaching the surrogate to avoid a neighbourhood that
was never actually bad.

The one fact the core cannot read
--------------------------------
Live tile count. How many tile-shaped tensors are simultaneously resident is a
dataflow property, and after the model has fused, flattened or reordered
anything it is a property of a program the extractor has never seen. On a
fused chain the optimizer may derive four live tiles where `ub_occupancy`
assumes two.

The model may report that number, with its reasoning, and may report nothing
else. It may not narrow a range, name a maximum, or otherwise touch the edges.
Without it the footprint bound is OFF -- stated in the notes rather than guessed
at, because a guess here is a guess in an unknown direction.

Which direction to fail
-----------------------
Wide. A bound that is too generous is caught per candidate: every configuration
is re-checked and an impossible one is rejected before it reaches the device. A
bound that is too tight cannot be detected at all -- BO behaves optimally inside
whatever box it is given, and an optimum outside the box leaves no trace anywhere
in the run.

This module previously ignored its own advice. It derived per-dimension domains
from the view's extents, on the assumption that a tile dimension must divide the
view it is cut from. That assumption is false, and the kernels say so: a tile's
leading dimension can be many times the view's. The rule collapsed such an axis
to a single element and capped another far below the extent the hand-optimised
version runs at. A search inside those boxes would have converged cleanly and
reported nothing wrong. It was removed rather than narrowed.
