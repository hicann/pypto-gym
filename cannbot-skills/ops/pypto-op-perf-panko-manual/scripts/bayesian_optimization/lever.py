"""Per-action Bayesian optimization over one kernel's tile sites.

The difference from `bo_stage7_init`, which runs one closed BO loop at INIT over
the whole numeric space and then hands off: this is a lever the search pulls
*inside* an action's refinement loop. Every time a tile action is selected the
core asks the study for one candidate, writes it, and reports the measurement
back. The two designs answer different questions and the earlier one is not
replaced.

Three reasons it belongs inside the loop rather than in front of it:

  * the optimal tile depends on the structure. After the model fuses two ops or
    changes a layout the tile chosen at INIT is stale, and a two-phase design has
    no way to revisit it.
  * budget. `run_bo` defaults to 40 trials; the whole run gets 90 device runs.
    Inside the loop BO spends nothing extra, because the refinement loop was
    going to burn those candidates on model guesses anyway.
  * the core ends up owning the number, which is what PANKO claims and what, for
    tile shapes, it has not been doing.

An Optuna study lives in one process and a PANKO run is a sequence of dispatches,
so the study is rebuilt from `search_state.json` on every call. `ask` / `tell`
rather than `study.optimize`, because the evaluation happens in the optimizer's
own cycle, not here.

    with many arguments -- so a 2-site kernel clears 32 draws most of the time,
    a 6-site kernel almost never, and a kernel carrying a dozen sites would need
    astronomically many draws for an even chance. That is what `no feasible
    candidate in 32 draws` was: not an exhausted neighbourhood, an impossible
    one. Moving one site at a time makes the acceptance rate p rather than p**n,
    and it is also what a win tends to look like -- one axis moved alone.

    Interactions are not lost, they are deferred: the seed phase still scales
    every site together, and the anchor advances whenever a candidate is kept, so
    the next site is drawn against the winner.
