"""A tile-tuning block: the core owns its own loop and returns one configuration.

The lever this replaces asked the study for a single candidate, handed it back to
the optimizer, and was asked again on the next cycle. That design put the tile
values inside the ratchet one at a time, which cost it twice. `stagnation_K`
counted BO trials, so an action closed after seven of them and TPE never warmed
up. And every intermediate value was judged by the ratchet on its own, so a tile
that only pays off together with a structural change could not be reached: the
structure is submitted at the stale tile, loses, and is reverted before the tile
that would have vindicated it is ever tried. A hand-optimised kernel is
typically exactly that pair -- a structural rewrite AND the tile that suits it,
neither of which wins alone.

A block runs the whole loop against a fixed base program and submits only the
winner. What reaches the ratchet is the pair.

    request  -> ask / apply / E(x) / tell,  n times, base restored between trials
             -> best_config, best_latency, and a summary

Two entry points, one mechanism: a tile action being selected, and the optimizer
asking for tuning after a structural change. The loop is identical; only what
happens afterwards differs.

Stopping
--------
Seven consecutive non-improving trials -- `stagnation_K`, the same number the
rest of the harness uses -- and nothing else. A trial cap looks like prudence
against the noise floor, on the reasoning that a large fraction of
"improvements" are draws rather than gains and a stagnation counter could be
reset indefinitely. It cannot be: the bar a trial must beat is the running
minimum, which only ever falls, so under pure noise the chance that trial n sets
a new record is about 1/n and seven consecutive non-records arrive quickly. A cap
would truncate real improvement to guard against a runaway the arithmetic rules
out.

The remaining evaluation budget bounds the block, but that is an accounting
limit and not a quality rule: a block may not start a trial it cannot pay for.

Budget
------
Every trial is a device evaluation and is charged as one. The caller charges the
losing trials and caches their bytes so they can never be paid for twice; the
winner is deliberately left uncached so the ordinary `record` path charges it and
runs the ratchet. The ratchet therefore stays in exactly one place.

    Keyed by the DERIVED TILE DOMAIN, not by the program text. This module used
    `lever.structural_signature`, which hashes the program with the tile
    literals erased -- unchanged by a tile value and changed by anything else at
    all. The repository already argues that this is the wrong test, in
    `domain.fingerprint`:

        `lever.structural_signature` is the obvious test and the wrong one,
        because it hashes the program with the tile literals erased, so a
        renamed variable or an added comment changes it [...] What actually
        invalidates a tile optimum is a change to the inputs of the derivation.

    That argument was made for the retune trigger and never carried across to
    the memory, so every non-tile edit threw the study away. The two questions
    are different -- "should another block run?" versus "are these measurements
    still admissible?" -- but they have the same answer, and it is the domain.

    WHAT THIS FIXES. Keyed on the source hash, the great majority of tile
    blocks begin at `replayed=0`, and a large share of those cold starts have no
    tile-space change behind them at all: a `pass_options` line, a reordered
    statement, a renamed intermediate. The ratchet rewrites the incumbent after
    every kept candidate, so the source hash moves constantly while the space the
    study searches stands still. Those blocks now inherit. So does the case the
    optimizer writes down and does not get -- an extent revisited later, which
    the source hash delivered only when the whole file happened to be
    byte-identical modulo tiles.

    WHAT THIS DOES NOT FIX, stated because it is the larger half. The other four
    fifths are an action whose own delta moves the view extent -- a granularity
    sweep walking TILE_B through a dozen values. There the domain genuinely
    differs, this key misses on purpose, and it should: latency is not comparable
    across extents, so replaying a measurement taken over ten times the work
    would teach the surrogate that a bigger block is a worse tile. That case
    needs a work-normalised objective and joint tile/extent search. It is not a
    key problem and this change does not pretend to address it.
