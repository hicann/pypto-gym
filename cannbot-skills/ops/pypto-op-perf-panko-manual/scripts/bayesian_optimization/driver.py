"""BO driver (Optuna TPE) for the numeric config subspace, correctness-constrained.

The objective is the SAME frozen evaluator E(x) that PANKO uses, wired in by the caller:

    objective(cfg) -> (s, p)
        s in {0,1} : correctness = golden_compare AND layout_check AND lint  (hard constraint)
        p          : measured latency (or geomean latency across shapes)

Correctness is a HARD constraint, exactly like PANKO's J = s * P_ref / p: an incorrect config
can NEVER win. A config that BO returns as best is therefore drop-in for PANKO cmd_record /
cmd_close — same referee, same J.

Three layers of infeasibility, cheapest first:
    1. static_feasible()  -> compiler-rule reject, no eval at all
    2. objective s==0     -> compile fail or golden mismatch (numerical)
Both are scored with a large penalty so TPE's surrogate learns to avoid that region
(e.g. "nbuffer=2 breaks this recurrent kernel", "this tile overflows L1") instead of re-drawing it.

No LLM runs inside this loop: suggest -> static check -> deterministic apply -> E(x). Fully
reproducible for a given seed.
