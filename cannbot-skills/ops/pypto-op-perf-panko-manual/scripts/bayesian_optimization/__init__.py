"""Bayesian optimization of the numeric tile space, for Stage 7.

Imported as a package, so a call site reads `bayesian.space.HW` rather than a
`bo_` prefix repeated on every module:

    import bayesian_optimization as bayesian

    apply      AST discovery of tile call sites, byte-exact argument rewriting
    normalize  is a proposed normalisation admissible? (static, INIT)
    space      discrete domains and the static feasibility gate
    lever      ask / tell over one action's tile sites, persisted in search_state
    driver     a closed TPE loop over a fixed program
    evaluator  the frozen E(x) wired as that loop's objective
    block      the two composed: one request in, one configuration out
    domain     the derived tile domain, and its fingerprint
    seed       space-covering start points
    semantic   is this candidate the same program as the incumbent?
    const      integer constants that set loop trip counts

`driver` and `evaluator` used to live only on `improve/bo-config-search`,
excluded from this package on the grounds that owning an evaluation loop "is the
one thing a per-action lever cannot do". That was true of a lever asked for one
candidate at a time and it was the wrong constraint: measured over two operators,
the per-candidate design produced three BO trials on one kernel and zero on the
other, and every tile that actually won was found by the language model. A block
owns the loop and is still fired at the lever's moment -- the INIT-time driver's
mechanism, at the per-action lever's timing.
