"""RealEvaluator — wire the FROZEN PANKO E(x) as the BO objective on the NPU.

    objective(cfg) -> (s, p)
        s = test_command exit 0  (golden_compare AND layout_check, per evaluator.md)
            AND  lint exit 0     (the Stage-7 implementation gates, if lint_root given)
        p = scripts/measure_latency.measure(...) (frozen warm latency)  when s==1, else None

Same referee as the harness, so a config BO returns is drop-in for cmd_record / cmd_close and
its J is comparable to every other candidate. Correctness stays a hard gate: s==0 => (0, None) =>
the driver scores it with the infeasible penalty and it can never be best.

Trial independence
------------------
BO explores configs; it does NOT accumulate them. So each trial applies cfg on top of the BASE
impl captured at construction (the accumulated global best at the moment BO is invoked), evaluates,
then RESTORES the base — trials never contaminate each other. After the search, call finalize(best)
once to write the winning config so the harness snapshots it via cmd_record.

Testability
-----------
`run_cmd` (shell -> returncode) and `measure_fn` (op_file -> {"p",...}) are injectable. Production
leaves them None: run_cmd = subprocess, measure_fn = the frozen scripts/measure_latency.py. Tests
pass fakes so the whole (s, p) contract, correctness gating, and base-restore run without an NPU.

        `torch.npu.set_device`, and the process then holds the device for the
