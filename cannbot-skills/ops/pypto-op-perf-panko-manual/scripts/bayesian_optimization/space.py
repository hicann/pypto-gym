"""Search space + STATIC hardware feasibility for the numeric config subspace.

MVP levers: cube L0 tile (m_l0/k_l0/n_l0) and vector tile (M/N).

Why a static pre-check exists
-----------------------------
In PANKO the LLM proposed tile numbers blind, so a large fraction of evals were spent
compiling configs that the compiler rejected instantly:
  - ERR_CONFIG_ALIGNMENT  "kL0(8) must be aligned to 16"        (u21)
  - ERR_CONFIG_TILE       "mL0=128 > mL1=64 ..."                (u9)
  - ERR_CONFIG_TILE       "kL0=128 > kL1a=64"                   (u60)
  - ALLOC_FAILED          L1 ~1MB > budget                      (u62)
static_feasible() reproduces these rules so BO never wastes an evaluation on a config the
hardware would reject. It is a CHEAP gate; numerical correctness is still decided later by the
frozen evaluator E(x) (golden compare), never here.

# One ladder now serves every dimension, because the arity is no longer fixed:

# independent pairs), so almost every device draw was rejected before it could
# measure anything. A multiplier makes the rule hold by construction while keeping
# a FIXED Optuna domain (a per-L0 choice set would be a dynamic domain, which
# Optuna forbids). The config still stores the actual L1 value (m_l1 = mL0 * x), so
# nothing downstream changes.
#
# The range stops at 4 on purpose: L1 holds BOTH operands (A = m_l1*k_l1, B =
# k_l1*n_l1) against a 512 KB buffer, so a multiplier of 8+ blows it on almost any
# L0 (128 x 8 = 1024, and a 1024-square L1 tile alone is 4 MB), and those draws
