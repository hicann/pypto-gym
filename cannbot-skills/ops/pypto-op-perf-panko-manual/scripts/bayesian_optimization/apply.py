"""Deterministic PER-SITE config applier: rewrite each tile-shape call site independently.

Per-site is the DEFAULT: different tile calls in a kernel are independent knobs. A kernel may set
one tile for its [BT,D] vec ops and another for its [BT,BT] ops, or use a smaller cube tile in an
unaligned branch — forcing every site to the same tile would both miscompile such kernels and
shrink the search. So the space is built PER discovered site; callers may optionally GROUP sites
that should move together (apply.group_identical) as an efficiency lever, but nothing is tied by
default.

Discovery is AST-based (robust to `pypto.` prefixes, whitespace, nested brackets, multi-arg cube
calls) and doubles as a parse check. Each site gets a stable id `"<kind>#<ordinal>"` in source
order (e.g. cube#0, cube#1, vec#0..vec#4). Rewrites replace only the call's argument list, so the
`pypto.set_*` prefix and everything else in the file are preserved byte-for-byte.

Tunable kinds: "cube" (set_cube_tile_shapes) and "vec" (set_vec_tile_shapes at ANY arity from one
to four integer arguments, exposed as d0..dk). A call whose arguments are not all integer literals
is "vec_dyn" / "cube_dyn": DISCOVERED but left untouched, because rewriting `set_vec_tile_shapes(M,
K)` with numbers would change the program's meaning rather than its tiling.

Materialize-absent: BO must explore the FULL numeric space, not only the literals the Stage-6
generator happened to emit. So discovery ALSO surfaces universally-insertable numeric knobs that are
MISSING — the runtime_options scalars (device_sched_mode / stitch_function_max_num) absent from a
`@jit(runtime_options={...})`, and `unroll_list` absent from a `pypto.loop(...)`. These become
zero-width "insertion" sites (start == end). Their current value is the sentinel UNSET (= leave it
out), which is always in the domain, so the original kernel is a reachable point and BO can also try
inserting the knob at real values — every candidate still gated by E(x), so an unsupported insert is
simply dropped. Absent CUBE/VEC tiles are not materialized: there is no deterministic place to insert
a tile the generator never wrote (that is a structural decision, left to PANKO).
