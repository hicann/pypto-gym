"""Is this candidate the incumbent, spelled differently?

A run can keep a single candidate out of a whole budget, and have it be this:

    for _ in pypto.loop(N, submit_before_loop=False):     # candidate
    for _ in pypto.loop(N):                               # incumbent

`False` is the parameter's own default. The two programs are the same program.
It is accepted because `J` is a function of the measured latency and this draw
came back lower than the incumbent's -- the same semantics measured three times
can span tens of percent. So the delivered kernel is no longer the byte-sequence
Stage 7 started with, for no reason at all.

The eval cache could not catch it: it keys on `code_hash` over raw bytes, and
these are different bytes.

What this module claims, and it is deliberately narrow
------------------------------------------------------
Passing a keyword argument its own declared default is the same call as omitting
it. That is Python's calling convention, not a claim about the compiler: the
tracer downstream receives an identical value either way, so there is nothing
for it to generate differently. Comments and formatting are handled for free by
comparing ASTs rather than text.

What it deliberately does NOT claim
-----------------------------------
That commutative operands may be reordered. The same run measured
`mul(t4, x_tile)` at 13.82 against `mul(x_tile, t4)` at 9.64 and concluded the
gap was noise -- but concluding it and establishing it are different things, and
canonicalising operand order would assert that this toolchain emits identical
code for both. Nothing here has measured that. A false positive in this module
DELETES a candidate the search would otherwise have tried, which is the
expensive direction to be wrong in, so the module only folds away things whose
equivalence is a property of Python.

`defaults` is supplied by the caller, from `inspect.signature` on the real
callables. Without it the comparison still catches reformatting and comment
edits, and folds nothing -- absent knowledge produces a weaker check, never a
wrong one.
