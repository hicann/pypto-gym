"""The chip envelope, DERIVED from the platform ini rather than transcribed.

The repository's own rule, from `ops/pypto-pro-op-perf-tune/references/
a5-roofline-and-levers.md`:

    Read the cube, HBM, UB, L1 and L0 figures out of the platform ini that ships
    with the runtime you are measuring, so no constant lives in this page and
    detaches from the installed version. Resolve <SKU> from the detected device
    rather than assuming it, and record which ini you read alongside the number.

PANKO transcribed six constants instead, taken from one SKU. Checking them back
against that SKU's ini says only that the transcription was faithful; it says
nothing about any other part.

They are already wrong on another SKU in the same family. Two SKUs can share an
NpuArch and carry the same five buffer sizes while differing in core count, so a
transcribed count understates one of them on every tiling decision the search
makes -- and no key coarser than the full SoC name would have caught it.

Per-SKU is not optional, and per-generation does not help either: two SKUs of one
generation can carry identical buffers and core counts that differ several fold.
Only some of the six figures move between generations at all, which is why
transcription survived this long without anyone noticing.

Resolution is direct: `acl.get_soc_name()` returns exactly the ini's basename,
so `<platform_config>/<soc>.ini` needs no mapping table.

    Asking without the id asks "what chip is in this box", which is the same

    every pyACL build accepts the argument, and a name for the box is still
