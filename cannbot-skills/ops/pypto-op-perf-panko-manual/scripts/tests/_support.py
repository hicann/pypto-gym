"""Shared test support: the harness under test, the paths to it, an envelope for
a run with no device, and a writer for synthetic platform inis.

`init` DERIVES the chip envelope from the platform ini and refuses when it
cannot, rather than falling back to a transcribed default -- so a test running
off-device has to supply one, exactly as a user on a box without CANN would.
`CHIP_ENVELOPE_OFFLINE` is that supplied envelope. It describes no device: it is
a set of round numbers large enough for the toy kernels these tests compile.

`write_platform_ini` writes the ini SHAPE -- the sections and option names
`chip_profile` reads -- with values chosen for the test. No real SKU's figures
are stored in this repository, and no ini ships as a file: a test that needs one
writes it into its own temporary directory.
