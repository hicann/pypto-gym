"""`infeasible_K` must be reachable from an action's FIRST candidate.

Both counters it bounds are moved by `feasible`, which runs before any device
measurement, while the record they live in used to be created only by `record`.
An action whose whole opening neighbourhood is rejected therefore never got a
record, both counters read 0 forever, and the bound could not fire -- so the
optimizer went on selecting an action that had never produced a measurable
candidate.

These drive the real CLI rather than calling internals, because the defect was
in which command owns the record.
