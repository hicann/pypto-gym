"""The tile block, driven with a stub objective and no device.

`block.run` and `driver.run_bo` were the two functions in this skill that
nothing exercised: they need optuna, and the reading of them was that they also
need an NPU. They do not. The objective is a callable the caller supplies, the
rest is AST work and TPE, and both are importable and deterministic here.

That matters because this is where the branch's two worst self-inflicted bugs
landed -- the `bo_domain` shadowing and the `space.dom` collision -- each of
which raised on the first real call and passed every test. These fix the
behaviour in place so that a change to the plumbing has to keep it: what is
proposed, how many trials are charged, which one is kept, and when it stops.
