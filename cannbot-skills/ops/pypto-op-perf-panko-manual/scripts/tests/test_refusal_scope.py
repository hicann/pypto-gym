"""A compiler refusal is evidence about the structure it was measured on.

`error_signature` keeps ErrCode + Enum + PassName and nothing else, and `F4FFFF`
is the generic FeError code that this repo's experience table maps to several
causes. So a signature being stable across occurrences of the same refusal --
which is what its docstring claims -- does not establish that two refusals
sharing one share a cause. Carrying a refusal to a structure it was never
measured on can therefore delete a legal tile from that program's space,
permanently and without a measurement.

Structure-scoped by default, promoted on evidence rather than on assumption.
