"""Which names in a source file mean `pypto`.

`<op>_impl.py` carries the kernel and the host wrapper together, and an alias is
legal, so every reader that has to tell a pypto call from a torch one needs this
same answer. It lived in two copies -- `predicates` and `bayesian_optimization.domain`
-- which is one copy too many for a test that decides whether a candidate's
statements count as kernel work.

Nothing here imports anything but `ast`, so both readers can have it without
taking on each other's dependencies.
