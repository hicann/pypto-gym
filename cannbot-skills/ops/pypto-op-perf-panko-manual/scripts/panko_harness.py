"""panko_harness.py — deterministic control core for Stage 7 PANKO (Arch A).

The world model is the persisted tree in `custom/<op>/optimization/search_state.json`.
This harness owns only the DETERMINISTIC parts of the loop — selection (argmax pypto_action_priority),
stagnation counting, j, tree-edit application, stop conditions, and state I/O. It runs
no LLM and needs no API key. The optimizer (the only reader of pypto-op-perf-panko-manual)
calls these subcommands each cycle; the reasoning (propose δ, rescore V, decide
Insert/Update/Prune, run the eval) stays with the optimizer.

All subcommands read/write <op_dir>/optimization/search_state.json and print a JSON
result to stdout. See references/state_schema.md for the schema.

  J(x) = s * (P_ref / p) * 100        # success stop when best_J >= 100
  V_pypto := pypto_action_priority = w_stage(stage) * prior_gain * novelty(tried) * V
    # pypto_action_priority (short symbol V_pypto) is OUR composite selection score — NOT from
    # the PANKO paper. V is PANKO's per-node value/belief and is only one of its factors.

    pushing a tile or a view against the buffer, which is where the interesting

    gets cheaper, the wrapper gets more expensive, `p` improves, and the ratchet
    keeps a candidate that is slower to run. The upstream review put it as
    kernel 100us -> 80us with 30us added to the wrapper, scored as a 20us win.

    Two of the catalogue's strongest recorded results were that shape -- F-21's
    fusion and F-22's layout copy. Neither made the work cheaper; both moved it
    out of the region `p` measures. Removing those actions is what makes the objective
    sound, and checking the signature is what makes the removal enforceable:
    the coder is handed free-form intents, and a rule that lives only in a
    document is a rule the search cannot rely on.

    Hashed over the AST rather than the bytes, so a comment, a blank line or a
    reformat outside the kernel is invisible and only a change to what the host
    actually DOES trips it. An added module-level import trips it too: that is
    deliberate erring, since the alternative is deciding which statements are
    "work" and a module constant feeding the wrapper's padding is work.

    Top-level jit functions are what this excludes. A kernel nested inside a
    class or a factory would be hashed as wrapper, which would make every tile
    rewrite look like drift -- no kernel in this repository is written that way,
    and the check says so rather than guessing.

    Returns None when the file does not parse -- callers treat that as "cannot
    tell" and say so, rather than passing a candidate the check never ran on.

    the frontier. It used to stay here at tried=0 and be re-selected at full

    Halving the priority is not enough. Several actions can each run the full
    `stagnation_K` measurements, every one closed "no successful candidate", and

    So retire it, on exactly the terms `evolve`'s conditional prune uses:
    `pruned_on` scopes the retirement to the structure now in the file, and
    `_live` revives the action automatically once a later delta changes that

    action with no refinement at all (a close aimed at an id that was never
    selected), a `refine` belonging to a different action, the documented escape
    hatch for a delta the coder found inexpressible at n=0, and the
    `infeasible_K` / `semantic_noop_K` / `dup_streak` releases. Retiring on any
