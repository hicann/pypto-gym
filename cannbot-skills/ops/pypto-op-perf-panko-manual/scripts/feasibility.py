"""feasibility.py --- reject hardware-infeasible candidates before they reach the device.

Ported from the numeric-feasibility idea in scripts/bayesian_optimization/bayesian.space.py on
improve/bo-config-search, and extended in the one way PANKO needs: Bayesian
optimisation owns its parameter space and can hand the checker a structured
config, whereas the optimiser here proposes free-form source edits. So the
tile parameters have to be recovered from the candidate file first.

What it catches, taken from the failures the 2026-07-28 campaign actually hit:

    F7A002 ALLOC_FAILED   TILE_B=2, view [2,16384] FP32:
                          2 rows = 128KB, plus 128x256 vec tiles = 128KB,
                          against a ~192KB unified-buffer budget
    ERR_CONFIG_ALIGNMENT  kL0 not 16-aligned
    ERR_CONFIG_TILE       mL0 > mL1, or mL1 % mL0 != 0

DESIGN RULE, and the reason this is safe to run on every candidate:

    reject ONLY when the violation is certain.

An unknown dtype is assumed to be the *smallest* plausible one, an unknown L1
envelope disables the L1 rules entirely, and anything the extractor cannot
parse is treated as feasible. A false rejection silently deletes a real
optimisation from the search space, which is far more expensive than the
evaluation a false acceptance wastes.

Usage:
    ok, reason = check("custom/<op>/<op>_impl.py")
