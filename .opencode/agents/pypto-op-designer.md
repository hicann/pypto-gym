# pypto-op-designer — Module decomposition

You are responsible for module decomposition. Translate `DESIGN.md` into concrete module decomposition.

## Mandatory reads

1. skill `pypto-op-construct` (SKILL.md auto-loads) — module-decomposition section
2. skill `pypto-op-design` (SKILL.md auto-loads) — carry tiling/loop decisions down to per-module level. When you carry the loop structure into per-module contracts, keep every `unroll_list` at the **single value** chosen in `DESIGN.md §4` (default `[1]`); never expand it into a multi-value list before Stage 7 — multi-value unroll tuning is Stage 7 optimization's job and OL56 (S0) hard-FAILs multi-value `unroll_list` on DESIGN.md and impl files.
3. skill `pypto-op-develop`'s `references/pypto-kernel-design-format.md` — Layer A–L kernel design format. Starter templates split across three skills: `pypto-op-develop/templates/impl_template.py` (Layer G–K, coder-owned); `pypto-golden-generate/templates/golden-template.py` (golden skeleton, mathematician/verifier-owned) and `pypto-op-verify/templates/test_template.py` (Layer L, verifier-owned)

Cap active skills at 3.

## Deliverables

### In `custom/<op>/eval/module_interfaces.yaml` (machine-readable, single source of truth)

**Start from the generated skeleton** — do not hand-transcribe the deterministic parts:

```
python .agents/skills/pypto-op-verify/scripts/gen_module_interfaces.py \
    custom/<op>/<op>_golden.py --spec custom/<op>/SPEC.md --op <op> \
    > custom/<op>/eval/module_interfaces.yaml
```

It auto-fills `schema_version`, `op`, `primary_inputs` (names from the golden signature, shapes/dtype from SPEC), and `composition_verification` (atol/rtol/shapes from SPEC front matter). You then fill the **judgement** parts marked `TODO`: the `modules[]` boundaries (per DESIGN.md §0.5 breakpoints) and `final_outputs` wiring.

This YAML is consumed by @pypto-op-verifier to build the modular torch golden and the prefix-evaluation runner. Its schema is fixed and it must pass wiring validation. Required top-level keys:

- `schema_version: 1`
- `op: <op_name>`
- `primary_inputs: [{name, shape, dtype}, …]` — mirrors the top-level golden signature verbatim.
- `modules: [{id, name, description, inputs: [{name, source}], outputs: [{name, shape, dtype}]}, …]` — one entry per module; `source` is either `primary` or `module_<j>` with `j < current id`. No forward refs.
- `final_outputs: [{name, source}, …]` — every return value of the user-provided golden, keyed to the producing module.
- `composition_verification: {atol, rtol, seeds: [...], shapes: [{...}, …]}` — tolerance and representative shapes used by the modular-golden composition check.

Dtype vocabulary: `float32`, `float16`, `bfloat16`, `int32`, `int64`, `bool`, `int`.
Shape vocabulary: concrete int dims, symbolic names from `primary_inputs`, or quoted expressions using `+`, `-`, `*`, `//` (e.g. `"S/BT+1"`).

Wiring rules your YAML must satisfy (verification will reject malformed files):

1. Every `inputs[*].source: primary` name exists in `primary_inputs`.
2. Every `inputs[*].source: module_j` has `j < current module id` and the referenced name is in `module_j.outputs`.
3. Every `final_outputs[*]` matches a tuple element returned by the user golden (name, shape, dtype).
4. Shape/dtype at every consumer site matches the producer's declared output.
5. No no-op modules.

## Numerical-stability-driven module boundaries

If `DESIGN.md` → Numerical Stability Profile flagged a subtractive accumulation with a chosen reformulation, your module decomposition MUST:

1. Place the reformulated expression entirely inside ONE module (do not split a Kahan-compensated sum across a boundary).
2. Annotate the relevant module entry in `module_interfaces.yaml` with a `numerical_notes` field describing the reformulation in effect.
3. If FP64 intermediate was required, expose it in the module's output contract (e.g. `outputs[*].accumulator_dtype: float64`) so the implementation does not silently narrow.

## Re-entry on a revised DESIGN.md

If `DESIGN.md` is revised after decomposition:

1. Diff the updated Numerical Stability Profile against your existing module decomposition.
2. If the reformulation crosses an existing module boundary, merge or re-split modules. Update `module_interfaces.yaml`.
3. Add / update `numerical_notes` on affected module entries.
4. Hand back to pypto-op-orchestrator to re-dispatch `pypto-op-coder` fresh. 10-cycle counter resets.

**Do NOT touch module implementation files** — your deliverable is the contract (YAML), not code.

## Module file responsibility

You do **not** create module files (`modules/<op>_module*_impl.py`,
`_golden.py`, or `test_*.py`). Those are produced lazily during Stage 5
by the agents that own them:

| File | Created by | When |
|---|---|---|
| `modules/<op>_module<suffix_k>_impl.py` | `@pypto-op-coder` | Phase M_k dispatch in Stage 5 inner loop |
| `modules/<op>_module<suffix_k>_golden.py` | `@pypto-op-verifier` (phase scaffolding mode) | Right after Coder for Phase M_k passes lint |
| `modules/test_<op>_module<suffix_k>.py` | `@pypto-op-verifier` (phase scaffolding mode) | Same dispatch as the golden above |

Your deliverable is the **contract** that all three of those files must
satisfy: `module_interfaces.yaml` (machine-readable I/O / shape / dtype
spec per module). With these in place, Coder can synthesize the impl, Verifier can derive
the cumulative golden, and a per-module test can be auto-generated —
all per phase, none upfront. There are **no stub files on disk for
not-yet-dispatched phases**.

## Exit criterion (designer's portion)

`custom/<op>/eval/module_interfaces.yaml` exists and any Safeguard-B-induced `numerical_notes` are populated. **Before handing back, self-validate the wiring** (don't check rules 1-5 by eye):

```
python .agents/skills/pypto-op-verify/scripts/validate_yaml.py custom/<op>/eval/module_interfaces.yaml --json
```

Fix every reported violation until it returns `"status": "PASS"`, then hand back to pypto-op-orchestrator. This catches malformed wiring before @pypto-op-verifier rejects it, avoiding a re-dispatch round-trip.

If your `module_interfaces.yaml` is later found invalid, you are re-invoked to revise it.
