# Qwen3.5-9B PyPTO Kernel Integration

HuggingFace `Qwen3_5ForConditionalGeneration` multimodal model definition modified to inject PyPTO fused operators on Ascend NPU hardware. This model (Qwen3.5-9B) is a vision-language model supporting hybrid attention: standard full attention layers alternate with linear attention layers based on the Gated Delta Rule (GDR).

## Integration Scope

| Operation | PyPTO Integrated | Fallback | Notes |
|-----------|:---:|----------|-------|
| Gated Delta Rule (chunk) | Yes | `chunk_gated_delta_rule` (FLA or torch) | Fused chunk-level GDR kernel for prefill with `qwen3_5_9b_pto_kernels` |
| RMSNorm | No | PyTorch `Qwen3_5RMSNorm` | Standard implementation, not fused |
| Gated RMSNorm | No | `FusedRMSNormGated` (FLA) or `Qwen3_5RMSNormGated` | Post-attention gated normalization |
| Full Attention | No | eager / flash_attn / sdpa | Standard HuggingFace attention |
| MLP (SwiGLU) | No | PyTorch `nn.Linear` | Standard |
| RoPE (MRoPE) | No | PyTorch `Qwen3_5TextRotaryEmbedding` | Interleaved MRoPE for multimodal positions |
| Vision Encoder | No | PyTorch `Qwen3_5VisionModel` | Full vision pipeline (patch embed, ViT blocks, merger) |
| Conv1D (causal) | No | `causal_conv1d_fn` (optional) or torch | Causal convolution in GDR pre-processing |

The Gated Delta Rule injection replaces the tensor-level chunk computation in `Qwen3_5GatedDeltaNet.forward()`. When the kernel switch is active and the model is in prefill mode (not using cached recurrent states), the PyPTO kernel handles the entire Q/K/V/Beta/Gate chunk computation as a single fused kernel call.

## Switch Variables

The kernel module is expected to expose the following attributes in `sys.modules["qwen3_5_9b_pto_kernels"]`:

| Variable | Type | Default | Description |
|----------|------|---------|-------------|
| `USE_PTO_GATED_DELTA_RULE` | `bool` | `False` | Enable PyPTO fused Gated Delta Rule chunk kernel for prefill |

## Kernel API Contract

When `USE_PTO_GATED_DELTA_RULE` is `True`, the kernel must provide:

```python
def gated_delta_rule_wrapper(
    query: torch.Tensor,   # [B, S, Nv, D]  (q/k already broadcast to Nv=32 by repeat_interleave)
    key: torch.Tensor,     # [B, S, Nv, D]
    value: torch.Tensor,   # [B, S, Nv, D]
    *,
    g: torch.Tensor,       # [B, S, Nv]  (fp32 log-gate, <= 0)
    beta: torch.Tensor,    # [B, S, Nv]
    initial_state: torch.Tensor | None,   # [B, Nv, D, D] or None (chunk path: None)
    output_final_state: bool = True,
    use_qk_l2norm_in_kernel: bool = True,
) -> tuple[torch.Tensor, torch.Tensor | None]:
    # Returns:
    #   core_attn_out: [B, S, Nv, D]
    #   last_state:    [B, Nv, D, D] or None
    ...
```

Envelope (raises `NotImplementedError` otherwise → upstream fallback): `B=1`, `Nv=32`,
`D=128`, `initial_state is None`, `use_qk_l2norm_in_kernel=True`.

The function replaces `chunk_gated_delta_rule` (either the FLA C++ implementation or the pure-torch fallback `torch_chunk_gated_delta_rule`). On `NotImplementedError`, the modeling code gracefully falls back to the original chunk function.

Key constraints:
- Only active during **prefill** (no cached recurrent state, `use_precomputed_states == False`)
- Decode (seq_len=1 with cached state) always uses `fused_recurrent_gated_delta_rule` (FLA) or `torch_recurrent_gated_delta_rule`
- Q/K L2-normalization (`use_qk_l2norm_in_kernel=True`) is expected inside the kernel

## Usage

The supported entry point is the ask script, which performs the
inject-before-transformers-import + enable-after-NPU-load sequence correctly:

```bash
MODEL_PATH=/path/to/Qwen3.5-9B \
  python3 modeling/transformers/qwen3_5_9b/ask_Qwen3.5-9B.py --use_pypto --device 0
# baseline vs PyPTO timing:
python3 modeling/transformers/qwen3_5_9b/bench_qwen3_5_9b.py --model-path /path/to/Qwen3.5-9B [--use_pypto]
```

Injection contract (what the ask script does):

```python
import sys
import qwen3_5_9b_pto_kernels as pk        # the ops package, before `import transformers`
sys.modules["qwen3_5_9b_pto_kernels"] = pk
# ... load model, move to NPU ...
pk.USE_PTO_GATED_DELTA_RULE = True          # enable AFTER the model is on the NPU
```

Set `USE_PTO_GATED_DELTA_RULE = False` to disable at runtime.

> **Note on loading:** the real `Qwen3.5-9B/config.json` has **no `auto_map`**, so the model
> loads the **built-in** `qwen3_5` architecture from the installed `transformers` package
> (`trust_remote_code` has no bundled file to load). `modeling_qwen3_5.py` / `configuration_qwen3_5.py`
> in this repo are **archival snapshots** of that built-in code with the PyPTO injection hook + Huawei
> NOTICE added (for reference/restore; upstream relative imports kept) — they are **not** loaded at
> runtime: the ask script imports the built-in class and injects PyPTO via `sys.modules` + monkey-patch.
> There is no `Qwen3_5Config()`-from-scratch path; always load real weights via `from_pretrained(MODEL_PATH)`.

## Architecture Highlights

The Gated Delta Rule (GDR) replaces standard attention in "linear_attention" layers with a recurrent state-space mechanism:

1. **Preprocessing**: Causal Conv1D over QKV projections for temporal smoothing
2. **Discretization**: Per-head learnable `A_log` + `dt_bias` produce timestep-dependent decay `g`
3. **Gating**: Per-head sigmoid `beta` controls delta magnitude
4. **Chunk Recurrence**: Sequence processed in chunks with intra-chunk attention and inter-chunk state passing
5. **Norm + Gating**: Post-attention norm applied with output gate `z` using `FusedRMSNormGated`

Layer type alternation pattern (default): 3 linear_attention layers → 1 full_attention layer → repeat.
